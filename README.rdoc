= RaiderStat

RaiderStat is a simple app I created to save me the effort of always having to
crawl http://nfl.com manually to collect the Oakland Raiders stats that I care
about.  As far as I can tell, there is not a single page anywhere on the
Internetz that I can get these stats.  So this app will scrape multiple pages
and aggregate the stats for me.
